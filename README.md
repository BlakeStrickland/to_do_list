This application will help you everyday by keeping track of your to-dos. Add new tasks with a description, due date, priority.

If priority changes, no sweat! Drag and drop any item (within the correct list) and reorder them any way you see fit.

If your completed tasks become too long, or you handed off the task to a trusty friend to take care of, go ahead and click the remove link and its gone forever.

To get started click the "New Task" link, fill in the appropriate fields, click the "Create Task" and BOOM, your on your way to setting up a fully functional to-do list.

When completed with a task just click the checkbox and it will automatically move into the completed tasks list. But don't worry, if you get a bit overzealous you can click that check box again to restore it to the incomplete tasks list.
